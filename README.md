# STM32F407 Driver Development Project
To develop my understanding of various embedded peripheals I decided to develop drivers for them. 
By developing these drivers it allowed me to fully understand the inner workings of each perhipeal.

## Drivers Developed
- GPIO
- SPI
- I2C
- UART
- RCC
- TIMERs
- DS1307
- LCD1602
